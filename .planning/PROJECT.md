# ARESWEB

## What This Is
The official dashboard, team portal, and website for ARES 23247 FIRST Robotics team. It provides authenticated management of team operations including tasks, posts, finance, robotics resources, and outreach.

## Core Value
Providing a highly accessible, fast, and feature-rich unified portal for students, mentors, and administrators.

## Context
ARESWEB is a brownfield project built heavily on Cloudflare Pages and D1 using Hono and React. It enforces high quality standards, including 100% backend function coverage and strict TypeScript compilation.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ **Authentication** — Better-Auth integration with role-based access control.
- ✓ **Tasks** — Kanban board, Zulip notifications, Markdown assignments.
- ✓ **Posts** — Blog and social media integrations, TipTap rich text.
- ✓ **Finance** — Ledger for transactions and sponsorships.
- ✓ **Analytics** — Aggregated team statistics.
- ✓ **Outreach** — External team engagement tracking.

### Active
- [ ] **Milestone 2 (Tech Debt Cleanup):** Address architectural fragility identified in `CONCERNS.md`, specifically resolving `waitUntil` test flakiness, standardizing Kysely database mocks, and hardening media upload validation.
- [ ] Maintain functionality of the website and ensure new features align with the strict CI/CD and coverage requirements.

### Out of Scope

- Self-hosting (Project relies strictly on Cloudflare's serverless edge ecosystem).

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Cloudflare D1 + Hono | Low latency, edge native, zero-config deployment. | Validated |
| 100% Test Coverage | Ensures no regressions in the API logic. | Validated |
